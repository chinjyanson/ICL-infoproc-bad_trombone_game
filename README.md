// Project Information

This project is a group coursework done in Year 2 Imperial EIE for Information Processing. We created a Unity game, that uses the accelerometer of the FPGA to play the game. Unfortunately the game will not work without 2 players and without FPGA's. To make up for that, you'll find below some images of our Project in action!
